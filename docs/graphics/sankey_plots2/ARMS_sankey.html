         Each flow connects a citation database on the left (Scopus, OpenAlex Seed, OpenAlex Full Text, Dimensions) to the journals it indexes (right).
         Journals indexed by multiple sources will have multiple flows.
         This diagram shows the top 40 journals (by total DOI count) included in at least one source for this dataset.
