# What Is the Issue? {.unnumbered}

Federal datasets play an important role in supporting research across a range of disciplines. Measuring how these datasets are used can help evaluate their impact and inform future data investments. Agencies like the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) track how their datasets are referenced in research papers and disseminate data usage statistics through platforms like *Democratizing Data's* [Food and Agricultural Research Data Usage Dashboard](https://democratizingdata.ai/tools/dashboard/food-agricultural-research/) and [NASS’s 5 W's Data Usage Dashboard](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Data_Visualization/5W/index.php). These tools rely on identifying *dataset mentions*^[A dataset mention refers to an instance in which a specific dataset is referenced, cited, or named within a research publication. This can occur in various parts of the text, such as the abstract, methods, data section, footnotes, or references, and typically indicates that the dataset was used, analyzed, or discussed in the study.] in published research to develop usage statistics. Beyond reporting usage statistics, this type of analysis can also provide information about the research topics where federal datasets are applied. Understanding how federal datasets are applied helps characterize their disciplinary reach, including use in areas such as food security, nutrition, and climate, which are inherently multidisciplinary. This informs future work on identifying alternative datasets that researchers use to study similar questions across fields.

The process of identifying dataset mentions in academic research output has two requirements. First, citation databases provide structured access to large volumes of publication metadata, including titles, abstracts, authors, affiliations, and sometimes full-text content. Second, tracking dataset usage requires developing methods that scan publication text for dataset mentions. It is feasible to systematically identify where specific datasets are referenced across a broad set of research outputs by applying [machine-learning algorithms](https://github.com/democratizingdata/democratizingdata-ml-algorithms/tree/main) to publication corpora collected from citation databases, allowing for scalable search and retrieval of relevant publications where datasets are mentioned. The accuracy of dataset tracking depends on the scope of research output we can access and analyze. However, different databases curate content (i.e., research output) in different ways - some focus on peer-reviewed journals while others include preprints and technical reports - and dataset tracking requires reliable citation data from citation databases.

This report presents a systematic review of identifying dataset mentions in research publications across various citation databases. In doing so, we compare publication, journal, and topic coverage across Scopus, OpenAlex, and Dimensions as primary sources. The purpose is to establish a consistent set of statistics for comparing results and evaluating differences in dataset tracking across citation databases. This allows for insights into how publication scope and indexing strategies influence dataset usage statistics.

# How Was the Study Conducted? {.unnumbered}

Three citation databases are compared: Elsevier’s Scopus, OurResearch's OpenAlex, and Digital Science's Dimensions.ai. 

1. **Scopus** charges for access to its citation database. It indexes peer-reviewed, including journal articles, conference papers, and books, and provides metadata on authorship, institutional affiliation, funding sources, and citations. For this study, Scopus was used to identify dataset mentions through a two-step process: first, Elsevier executed queries against the full-text ScienceDirect corpus and reference lists within Scopus; second, publications likely to mention USDA datasets were filtered based on keyword matching and machine learning models.

2. **OpenAlex**, an open-source platform, offers free metadata access. It covers both traditional academic publications and other research outputs like preprints and technical reports. In this study, we used two approaches to identify dataset mentions in OpenAlex: a full-text search, which scans publication metadata fields such as titles and abstracts for references to USDA datasets,^[Full-text search in OpenAlex refers to querying the entire database for textual mentions of dataset names within titles, abstracts, and other fields.] and a seed corpus search, which starts with a targeted set of publications based on journal, author, and topic criteria, then downloads the full text of each paper to identify mentions of USDA datasets.^[The seed corpus search involves selecting a targeted set of publications based on journal, author, and topic filters. Full-text PDFs are downloaded and analyzed to identify mentions of USDA datasets not captured through metadata alone.] 

3. **Dimensions**, developed by Digital Science, is a citation database that combines free and subscription-based access. It indexes a range of research outputs, including journal articles, books, clinical trials, patents, datasets, and policy documents. Dimensions also links publications to grant and funding information. For this study, publications in Dimensions that reference USDA datasets were identified by constructing structured queries in Dimensions’ Domain Specific Language (DSL) that combined dataset aliases with institutional affiliation terms. These were executed via the `dimcli` API to return English-language articles from 2017–2023 with at least one U.S.-affiliated author. To maintain consistency with the criteria applied to Scopus and OpenAlex, the study focuses only on publications classified as journal articles.

To compare how these databases track dataset usage, we focus on six USDA datasets commonly used in agricultural, economic, and food policy research:

1. Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS)
2. Census of Agriculture (Ag Census)
3. Rural-Urban Continuum Code (RUCC)
4. Food Access Research Atlas (FARA)
5. Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS)
6. Household Food Security Survey Module (HHFSS)

These datasets were selected for their policy relevance, known usage frequency, and disciplinary breadth. We developed seed corpora for each dataset to identify relevant publications, then used those corpora to evaluate database coverage, topical scope, and metadata consistency.

# What Did the Study Find? {.unnumbered}

Tracking dataset mentions varies significantly depending on which citation database is used. This analysis compares Scopus, OpenAlex, and Dimensions to determine how each citation database captures research mentioning key USDA datasets. Key findings are detailed below.

### 1. Publications {.unnumbered}

Overlap across databases is limited. For most datasets, fewer than 10% of DOIs appear in all three sources. Scopus often identifies the largest share of indexed DOIs, especially for public health–related datasets. OpenAlex captures a broader set of publication types, including preprints and working papers. Dimensions often sits in the middle but includes the highest number of matched DOIs for some datasets.

### 2. Journals {.unnumbered}

Scopus emphasizes disciplinary journals, particularly in health, economics, and social science. OpenAlex includes a mix of traditional and nontraditional outlets, including open-access platforms. Dimensions covers many of the same journals as Scopus but with a stronger presence of applied policy and public health titles.

### 3. Topics {.unnumbered}

While the same datasets appear across all three sources, the topical classifications differ.

- ARMS is associated with farm management, production economics, and sustainability.
- Census of Agriculture connects to agricultural structure, environmental policy, and rural development.
- Food Access Research Atlas highlights food security, neighborhood-level inequality, and planning.
- FoodAPS centers on household behavior, SNAP, and diet cost.
- HFSSM is tied to poverty, food insecurity, and health disparities.
- RUCC connects to rural healthcare, regional planning, and demographic trends.

Each source applies a different classification system, which affects how these themes are surfaced and grouped.

### 4. Authors {.unnumbered}

Scopus and Dimensions tend to recover more academic authors in applied economics, public health, and nutrition. OpenAlex often identifies a wider array of author types. Across sources, many of the most active authors are affiliated with USDA Economic Research Service, major land-grant universities, and schools of public health.

### 5. Institutions {.unnumbered}

Institutional representation varies, with Scopus and Dimensions surfacing more authors from top-tier research universities and federal agencies. OpenAlex includes more community-based organizations and international institutions not always indexed in Scopus.

### Evaluating Corpus Coverage Across Sources {.unnumbered}

Among the three sources examined, Dimensions offered the most consistently structured metadata linking datasets to publications. Its combination of broad journal coverage, funder metadata, and curated topic tags allowed for easier identification of research that referenced USDA datasets, particularly in applied and policy-relevant contexts.

Although Scopus recovered the largest number of publications for certain datasets and fields, and OpenAlex captured a wider range of publication types (including international and open source journals), Dimensions provided the most streamlined path to assembling a usable corpus with fewer manual adjustments. This made it especially useful for mapping the reach of a dataset across disciplines and institutions.

Ultimately, each source contributed unique value to the analysis, and comparing across systems helped surface important differences in coverage and classification.

**Takeaway:**

No single citation database captures the full scope of research publications referencing USDA datasets. Differences in indexing practices, topic labeling, and metadata structure shape what research is discoverable and how it is interpreted. Among the sources evaluated, Dimensions provided the most consistent, policy-relevant, and accessible view of dataset usage making it a strong candidate for future efforts to track the reach and impact of publicly funded data.
