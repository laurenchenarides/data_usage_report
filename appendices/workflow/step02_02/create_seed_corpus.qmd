## Creating a Seed Corpus: Scopus {#sec-seed-corpus .unnumbered}

For Scopus and OpenAlex, a structured seed corpus was used to establish a more targeted search space. This seed corpus approach was necessary to balance recall (capturing relevant mentions) and precision (minimizing false positives). The process involved:

- Restricted search strategies using reference lists and available full-text searches
- Machine learning-assisted review to refine dataset mentions
- Manual refinements to resolve ambiguities, consolidate duplicate aliases, and incorporate missing terms.

This structured search space helped mitigate the constraints of Scopus's API and address the limitations of the OpenAlex full-text search to ensure that dataset mentions were captured as comprehensively as possible.

<!-- -   Collect an initial set of publications. -->
<!-- -   Analyze how datasets are referenced. -->
<!-- -   Determine how well the dataset name variations (from Step 1) are retrieved from the publications. -->
<!-- -   Adjust searches to improve accuracy. -->

<!-- **Result:** A set of seed publications to inform dataset identification and search procedures. -->
