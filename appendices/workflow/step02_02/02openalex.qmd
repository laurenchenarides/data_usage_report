## OpenAlex

### Rationale {.unnumbered}

Given the limitations of OpenAlex full text search, a **Seed Corpus** and **Search Corpus** were used to facilitate more accurate identification of USDA dataset mentions in scholarly publications within the OpenAlex citation database.

### Description of the Problem {.unnumbered}

Publications identified by dataset mention searches using Scopus were cross-verified in OpenAlex by searching their DOIs. These publications were confirmed to be open-access and available for full-text searches in OpenAlex. However, upon closer investigation, two primary issues were identified with OpenAlex's full-text indexing methods:

1. **PDF vs. NGRAMS Indexing Methods**:
    - **PDF Method**: OpenAlex receives the publication's full text in PDF format and indexes the content directly.
    - **NGRAMS Method**: OpenAlex receives from the author or publisher a preprocessed set of words or phrases (ngrams) extracted from the publication's full text.

2. **Specific Issues**:
    - **PDF Method Issue**: Although undocumented, we observed that the text from the references section of the publications was not indexed by OpenAlex. This occurs because OpenAlex processes the references section specifically to create pointers to other OpenAlex works being referenced. While this approach functions well for publications referencing other scholarly publications, it fails to identify dataset mentions in the references.
    - **NGRAMS Method Issue**: The provided set of ngrams might not include all relevant words or phrases required for dataset identification. For example, if searching for a specific alias such as "USDA Census," the provided ngrams might not contain the exact phrase or all necessary words, causing missed dataset mentions.

These limitations with OpenAlex's indexing methods highlighted the need to create dedicated seed and search corpora for accurate dataset mention identification.

### Creating the Seed Corpus {.unnumbered}

The seed corpus generation aims to create an effective subset of publications available in OpenAlex to download locally and subsequently run text searches for dataset aliases and flagged terms.

### Filtering Criteria {.unnumbered}

To define the seed corpus, several criteria were established based on topics, publication type, publication year, language, and open-access availability. Below are detailed descriptions of the chosen criteria and associated publication counts.

### Topics {.unnumbered}

We identified relevant topics based on their frequency and relevance. Below are the top 100 topics by publication count:

| **Topic ID**                | **Topic Name**                                                    | **First Run Count** | **OpenAlex Total Count** |

Filters applied:
- **Language**: English (en)
- **Publication Year**: >2017
- **Type**: article, review
- **Open Access**: True

Filtered publications count: **3,714**.

### Generating the Search Corpus {.unnumbered}
 
Upon applying the agreed filters, the final seed corpus resulted in **1,774,245 unique publications**. An initial Python script was developed to collect full texts of these publications.

### Initial Full Text Download Results {.unnumbered}

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Total publications attempted | 2,774 |
| Successfully downloaded full-texts | 974 |
| Success Rate | 35% |
| Estimated full texts (projected) | 625,000 out of 1,774,245 |
| Total estimated processing time | ~124 days |

The relatively low success rate indicates significant challenges in accessing full texts, primarily due to missing or inaccessible OA URLs.

### Current Limitations and Considerations {.unnumbered}
 
- Only **35%** success rate in downloading full texts.
- The existing process is slow, computationally intensive, and likely to require improvements or distributed computing.
- Comparison with OpenAlex's built-in full-text search shows it might be sufficient in certain cases, potentially reducing the necessity of local processing.

### Next Steps {.unnumbered}

- Implement distributed processing to accelerate corpus generation.
- Assess the adequacy of OpenAlex’s built-in full-text search for practical usage scenarios.
- Balance the need for accuracy with available resources (time and cost).

### References {.unnumbered}

### Conclusion {.unnumbered}

Creating a locally processed seed corpus from OpenAlex significantly improves dataset mention accuracy but poses considerable resource demands. While local full-text processing enhances specificity, careful consideration is required regarding when OpenAlex’s native search capabilities are sufficient.
