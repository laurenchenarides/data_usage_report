## Extract Dataset Mentions to Build a Publication Dataset {#sec-data-idn .unnumbered}

<div style="background-color: #f9f5d7; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 0;">
<strong>The goal of this step is to build a dataset of publications that reference the dataset name aliases for the USDA data assets  across Scopus, OpenAlex, and Dimensions.</strong> </div> 

To generate this dataset, the process requires:

- Dataset name aliases (from Step 1)
- Search routines tailored to each citation database to extract relevant publications

Search routines, described below, guide this step, as dataset mentions are often inconsistent across publicationsâ€”appearing in titles, abstracts, full text, or reference lists. Scopus uses a structured seed corpus to refine searches; OpenAlex uses both a full text search and defines a seed corpus; Dimensions relies only on direct queries across their full publication records. The outputs of this step are three publication-level datasets, one for each citation database, which are further analyzed in subsequent steps.
